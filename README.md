# ⚠️ ABANDONED MOD ⚠️

This mod isn't very good in its current form as the way it achieves its goals is rather crude and heavy handed, making it somewhat incompatible with other mods by easily breaking various things. I might make a new mod that does what this mod does, but better at a later time, but it's currently not a high priority for me.

I don't really recommend anyone continues this mod in its current form, but should you want to, you have my blessing. I will leave the mod up on Steam and my GitHub repo up for the foreseeable future for anyone to grab the source code from.

# Have you ever wondered...
...why your intellectual colonists who have researched the secrests of the universe, or the crafters of your colonies who have produced artifacts of such quality that news of them spreads across the lands, can't seem to craft bionic equipment that has above standard efficiency?

Well, now you don't have to wonder any longer! Introducing quality bionics! Stronger bionics for smarter people.

Prostheses at bionic level and above now have quality levels that affect the efficiency of the part. Because, let'ss face it, someone had to have figured out a way to make a circuit in the unit a little bit better.

## Known mod incompatibilities

-   Elite Bionics Framework -- interferes with the way this mod works. I'm working towards adding a compatibility patch.[^ebf]
